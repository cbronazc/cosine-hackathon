1st go into content-engine and install the requirements.txt (will take a while)

then you can run `python cosine.py`

or for content engine go into that folder and then run each of these in a different terminal

* redis-server (separate terminal)
* python web.py
* from the engines.py file run the train CURL and then the predict CURL
